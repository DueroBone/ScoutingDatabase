All team info are in Events/"Event name"/Teams  <br />
For team info, there is:  <br />
    liveScrapedInfo which contains data from statbotics <br />
    staticScoutedInfo which is information that is scouted at before the game begins    <br />
    Round"X" which details that team's observed contributions during that match.    <br />
Scouted information goes into the folder Events/"Event name"/Input, and will be filtered down to the teams folder   <br />
